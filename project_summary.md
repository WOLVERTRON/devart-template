# Flocking Bristles
## Authors
- Chris Wolverton,  WOLVERTRON

## Description
Flocks, swarms, herds, and schools of simple intelligences are fascinating to watch. Tracking individuals through time via a path can reveal beautiful patterns. Applying artistic choices for brush sizes, colors, and opacity can result in layered patterns reminiscent of those found in the smallest and largest scales of nature.
